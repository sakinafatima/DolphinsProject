Since the video dataset is very big (568 GB), only a sample video “sampleVideo.mp4” is provided to show image processing part. 
In order to run the files name mentioned in the “LabelsdatabyCREEMTEAM.csv” file, 
it is required that code is implemented on the video’s dataset provided by the CREEM team.
The video path should be updated in the code depending upon the location of the dataset in the PC. 

The files should be run in following order: 
-MeanVelocity_HDBScanALgorithm.py or MeanVelocity_KMeans.py
-ML_Models_multiclass.py
-ML_models_Binary.py
-Models_velocity_clutsters.py
